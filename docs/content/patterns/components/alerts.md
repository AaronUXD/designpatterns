### Contextual alerts

Provide contextual feedback messages.

- __Info__ alerts can be used when there are tips/information that a user can benefit from. 
- __Success__ alerts can be used when an action was performed successfully.
- __Warning__ alerts can be used when an action is out of the ordinary or might not be desired.
- __Danger__ alerts can be used when the system has failed to perform an action, or when the user has made an error.
