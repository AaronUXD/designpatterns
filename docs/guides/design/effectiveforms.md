###Effective forms

Web forms provide an incredible advantage over paper forms in their potential for accessibility, usability, and operational efficiency, but when designed without users in mind they can lose many of these benefits. In this guide, weâ€™ve outlined several ways to ensure the best possible user experience.

####Choosing a form structure

The structure of your form should fit with the ways in which your users will want to use it.

Ask yourself:

- Will your users want to move through the form in a fixed order, or one of their choosing?
* Will they be able to complete the form in a single go?
* Will their answers affect other parts of the form?
* Will they want to go back and review or change answers to previous questions?
* Will they need to add or remove items from a list, or change the order of things?
* How many parties are involved in the form?
* Do any parts of the form take place offline?
* At what point is the form regarded as complete?

How you answer these questions will help you decide how to structure the form. It can help to think in terms of levels: sections, subsections, groups, etc. Try not to worry about how those levels should be represented in the interface until you have a broader understanding of the overall structure.

For example, on a website, you might choose to have one section per page, or multiple sections per page. It depends on what's going to work best for your users.
