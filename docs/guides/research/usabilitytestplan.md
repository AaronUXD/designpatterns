###Document Overview

This document describes a test plan for conducting a usability test during the development of <font color="red">[web site name or application name]</font>.

The goals of usability testing include establishing a baseline of user performance, establishing and validating user performance measures, and identifying potential design concerns to be addressed in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction

> *add or delete goals*

The usability test objectives are:

 - To determine design inconsistencies and usability problem areas
   within the user interface and content areas. Potential sources of
   error may include:
   - **Navigation errors** – failure to locate functions,
   excessive keystrokes to complete a function, failure to follow
   recommended screen flow.
   - **Presentation errors** – failure to locate and properly act upon desired information in screens, selection errors due to labeling ambiguities.
   - **Control usage problems** – improper toolbar or entry field usage.
 - Exercise the application or web site under controlled test conditions with representative users. Data will be used to access whether usability goals regarding an effective, efficient, and well-received user interface have been achieved.
 - Establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future usability evaluations.

> Add a paragraph that summarizes the user groups that the application or Website will be deployed/launched to, the user groups that will participate in the usability test and the number of participants from each user group that are expected to participate. Indicate whether the testing will occur in a usability lab or remotely and the expected date range for testing.
