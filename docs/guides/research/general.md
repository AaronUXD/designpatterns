###Interview best practices

####Planning best practices
- Create a list of the issues and general questions that have been identified during knowledge exchange at the start of the sprint.
- Be clear about the scope and desired outcome and the specific area of business activity or subject. 
- Clearly articulate the business problem or challenge for which you need help and the objective of the interview. Be prepared for these to be reframed in the course of the interview.

####Process lessons learned

- Provide a few sample questions for interviewees and observers 2-3 days prior to the interview.
- At the start of the interview, introduce the purpose of the discussion, the roles represented, and the agenda 
- If the interview is being recorded, verbal permission must be obtained
- Level of experience with: USPTO, PE2E, and topic being discussed

####Consolidating information gained
- Meet immediately after the interview with teammates to discuss and summarize knowledge gained.
- Perform analysis and prepare a review of the knowledge gained from the sessions in a concise manner that can be leveraged and re-used by others. This information should summarized in a manner which domain experts can comment on.
- Identify universal and contending knowledge and note accordingly 
- Develop a process map or workflow of the knowledge, and link the specific nuggets of knowledge with the relevant process sub-processes, activities and input and output elements.
- Describe the impact or business result enabled by the application of this knowledge and why it made a difference. Quantify or qualify the pain or gain
- Why is this important to examiners what are the key considerations


####Asking questions

- Ask open ended questions vs. ones with Yes and no answers
- An iterative questioning process, open question – clarifications as needed – open question – will 
typically yield more effective results because it encourages people to reflect and “think what they 
say.”  

- Reduce ambiguity with follow up questions
•	‘Take enough time’: How long a time you would say would be appropriate? 
•	‘Everybody should participate’: What organizations would you say should be involved? 
•	‘This project went really well’: How does this compare with other projects you have been involved in? What was different this time? 
•	‘This is a difficult problem’: What makes it difficult?
•	‘We couldn’t do better’: What would other teams need to do in the future, in order to assure they do better? 


####Probes

- Sample probes from (Hoffman 2005)
•	What sub-tasks or action sequences are involved in this activity?
•	What information does the practitioner need?
•	Where does the practitioner get this information?
•	What does the practitioner do with this information?
•	What forms have to be completed?
•	How does the practitioner recover when glitches cause problems?
•	How does the practitioner do work-arounds?
- Sample probes:
•	Describe the steps you’d go through to accomplish X, Y, Z.  
•	Who are other critical participants in the process and why?  
•	For the functions that you’ve participated in, what are some of the key factors that led to success?  
•	What surprised you most?  
•	What frustrated you most?  
•	What “aha” insights did you gain during the process?  
•	If you were starting again tomorrow, what would you do differently?
- "Action Requirements Analysis" page 60
•	Task Designation or Identifying goal
•	What is the action sequence?
•	What cognitive activities are involved in this task/activity?
•	In what ways can the activity be difficult? What about the support or information depiction makes the action sequence difficult?
•	What are the informational cues? How are they depicted?
•	What is the technology or aid, and how does it help? What is good or useful about it?
•	Are any work-arounds?
•	Are there any local "kludges" to compensate for workplace or technology deficiencies?
•	What kinds of errors can be made?
•	What kinds of additional aids might be useful?
Decision Requirements Tables - Protocols for CTA p.56
In the analysis, one DRT is completed for each task or worker goal. The DRT specifies:
• The action sequence involved in the task,
• The equipment, tools, forms, etc. that are used to conduct the task,
• A specification of the information the person needs in order to conduct the task,
• Notes about what is good and useful about the support,
• Notes about ways in which the support makes the task unnecessarily difficult or awkward, or
that might be improved.
•	What is the decision? What are the goals, purposes, or functions? Why does this decision have to be made?
•	How is the decision made? What information is needed?
•	What are the informational cues?
•	In what ways can the decision be difficult?
•	How do you assess the situation or broader context for this decision?
•	How much time or effort is involved in making this decision?
•	What is the technology or aid, and how does it help?
•	Are any work-arounds?
•	Are there any local "kludges" to compensate for workplace or technology deficiencies?
•	What kinds of errors can be made?
•	What kinds of additional aids might be useful?
•	Protocols for CTA p.58
•	When this decision has to be made, are there any hypotheticals or "what ifs?"
•	What are your options when making this decision?

Activity
•	What are the goals of this activity?
•	What skills, knowledge, and experience are needed for successful accomplishment of this activity?
•	What information is needed for successful accomplishment of this activity?
•	What about the system makes the goal easy to achieve?
•	What about the system makes the goal difficult to achieve?
