### Hybrid

For more complicated forms, some combination of the other options might be your best bet.

Done well, this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help users understand when they have moved into a different part of the form, and break up the monotony of filling in forms.

As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.
