<h3>Form: Hybrid</h3>

#### Purpose
Users need guidance filling out a complex, multi-step form.


#### Description
For more complex forms, a combination of the single page and wizard layouts may give you the benefits of both approaches. A hybrid layout can accommodate long forms and help users understand their progression through all the steps.

As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.
