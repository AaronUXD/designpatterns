<h3>Help</h3>

#### Purpose
Users need to understand the processes, forms, and data they're interacting with.

#### Description
Help can be provided in a lot of different ways. When and how you provide help depends on the amount of help needed, the type of process/interaction, and your target audience. Too much contextual help can actually make interfaces harder to understand, but insufficient help will frustrate new users.

Some of the ways help can be provided are:

- Dedicated help and FAQ page(s)
- Above and in forms ([See Forms page](../components/forms.html#help-text))
- Below form input fields ([See Forms page](../components/forms.html#help-text))
- Popovers when form input fields are focused ([See Forms page](../components/forms.html#help-text))
- Popovers with definitions/descriptions when hovering over a label/term/word
- 'Learn more' links and 'Information' icons
