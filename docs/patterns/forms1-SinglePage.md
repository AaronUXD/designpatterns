<h3>Form: Single page</h3>

#### Purpose
Users need guidance filling out a form where all sections are positioned on a single page.

#### Description

<div class="row">

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
#### The good

* There's only one submit button to press
* A single URL gives access to all form fields
* It doesn't force a fixed order of completion
* You benefit from context of neighboring sections
* Progress is self-evident
</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
#### The bad

* Long forms can be overwhelming and off-putting
* It's less well suited to branching or non-linear flow
* How do you save partial progress?
* Can be harder to track analytics like drop-off rates
</div>
